Arcane Atlas is an easy to use character and campaign manager for D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) that works on desktop and mobile. It allows users to play D&D using only the app, and it's meant to make D&D more approachable and simple for new players, while still giving veteran players access to all the options they might want. You can create, edit, level up, and play with characters in a game session. The app is focused on offline use, and as such users do not need to make any kind of account for the app, and all their D&D content is stored locally. Users can also import and export characters and content to use on other devices. The project is written with the Flutter GUI framework and Dart, and it uses MongoDB's Atlas Device SDK (previously called Realm) as a database.
